Hello!

Miraheze moved from GitHub to [Phabricator](https://meta.miraheze.org) for issue tracking, after April 2016. We no longer recognize/fix issues reported on GitHub.

Please use Phabricator for reporting issues. It won't take long to make an account there, since we offer OAuth integration to our Miraheze wikis and GitHub. Phabricator's markup is almost identical to GitHub's one, so you'll get used to it very fast.

Thank you!

This issue will be closed when someone with the permission notices this. No actions will be taken unless you report it on our Phabricator.
