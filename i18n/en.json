	"about-desc": "In July 2015, John Lewis and Ferran Tufan created a new wiki farm - named Miraheze. Through the use of community crowdfunding and personal investment, Miraheze officially went live in August of 2015. Over the years, the project has grown immensely to be one of the largest and most recognizable wiki farms specializing in MediaWiki on offer. Despite the success and evolution, one aspect of Miraheze never changed - formal existence. In November 2019, Miraheze became a registered non-profit in the UK as Miraheze Limited.",

	"fundraising-sitenotice": "As all of you know, Miraheze is a community-centric, ad free, and community driven hosting platform funded 100% by donations. We've been fortunate to once again continue seeing impressive year-over-year traffic and community growth. With that growth, though, comes the need for additional infrastructure to manage increased capacity as well as paying for the already existing infrastructure. So, we ask for you to consider chipping in with £5, £10, £20, or whatever amount you can afford. If 500 of Miraheze's 100,000+ users gave only $1 once a year, Miraheze would exceed its budget requirements. Donate via our [https://www.gofundme.com/f/$2|GoFundMe page], [https://paypal.me/mirahezelimited|PayPal] or [https://github.com/sponsors/miraheze|GitHub Sponsors]! \n To thank you for your support, you have the option of on-wiki acknowledgement if you include your wiki username with your donation."
