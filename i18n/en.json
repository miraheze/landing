Through the use of community crowdfunding and personal investment, Miraheze officially went live in August of 2015. Over the years, the project has grown immensely to be one of the largest and most recognizable wiki farms specializing in MediaWiki on offer. Despite the success and evolution, one aspect of Miraheze never changed - formal existence. In November 2019, Miraheze became a registered not-for-profit in the UK as Miraheze Limited. In Janurary 2024 operations were transfered to WikiTide Foundation.",

With our impressive growth though, we need more infrastructure to handle increased demand. We ask you, earnestly, consider chipping in $5, $10, $20, or whatever you can afford. If 550 of Miraheze's 300,000+ users gave only $16 once a year, Miraheze would exceed its budget requirements.",
