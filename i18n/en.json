Through the use of community crowdfunding and personal investment, Miraheze officially went live in August 2015. Over the years, the project has grown immensely to be one of the largest and most recognizable wiki farms specializing in MediaWiki on offer. Despite the success and evolution, one aspect of Miraheze never changed: formal existence. In November 2019, Miraheze became a registered not-for-profit in the UK as Miraheze Limited. In January 2024 operations were transferred to the WikiTide Foundation.",

If 550 of Miraheze's 300,000+ users gave only $16 once a year, Miraheze would exceed its budget requirements.",
